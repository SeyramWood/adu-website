          A.D.U. offers 3-year liberal arts undergraduate programs; the only
          university of its kind in the Sahel, and we hope to be a model that
          other schools will follow. To further enhance the educational
          experience, teaching at A.D.U. is split between on-the-ground faculty
          who each have international education and experience, and top-tier
          remote-based faculty from around the world.

          <p>
            Niger 2.0 Smart Villages program was launched in August 2018 by the
            Government of Niger and its partners (ITU, FAO, UNESCO, WHO, WB), to
            expand internet access to digitally enabled services in education
            and other sectors (health, agriculture, commerce etc.). Yet, there
            is a lack of quality technology education programs in Niger and
            across the Sahel region. Thus, the Bachelor of Science in Artificial
            Intelligence (BS-AI) program is designed to bridge the
            Science-Technology-Innovation (STI) workforce gap and to drive the
            digital transformation agenda of Niger and the Sahel region.
